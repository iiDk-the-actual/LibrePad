# Introduction

Librepad is a free, open sourced info and utility tablet for Gorilla Tag. Inspired by other mods, such as [EIOP](https://github.com/Hansolo1000falcon/eiop) and [Sakuraa's Utility Tablet](https://gtagcamera.com), this mod is meant to be a free and backdoorless situation.

This mod was created as a solution to everyone's problems. A genre of mod that has been getting popular is the utility tablet genre, where a menu spawns on your hand to complete actions easily. 

The problem with the released solutions is that they either:
1. Cost money
2. Are obfuscated
3. Include game-controlling backdoors
   
I believe that information should be free and public for anyone to access without bloat or backdoors, whether or not Gorilla Tag or the modding community deems it bannable. Mods like this are fairly simple to make, and anyone putting paywalls behind them are nothing but pots of greed.
